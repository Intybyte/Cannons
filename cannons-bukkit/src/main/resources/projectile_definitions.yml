# # Quick tutorial on how to make a projectile definition
# # this will replace <projectile>.entityType
# "<my_server_name>:<my_server_projectile>":  # you can put anything as long as there is a semicolon in the middle, this will identify the projectile
#    entity: "SNOWBALL" # snowball if null, any entity name, these are all valid https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/entity/EntityType.html
#
#    # these fields are used to change how the projectiles behave,
#    # however options different from default values can behave in a "sluggish" way
#    # if not set, they will use the default values of the entity
#    constantAcceleration: 0.1 # optional, stuff like fireball that will travel forever have this, default is null or 0 for snowballs
#    gravity: 0.03
#    drag: 0.99 # high drag means the projectile looses less speed, so a low drag will mean that the projectile will slow down faster
#    waterDrag: 0.8 # same as drag but for water and/or liquids
#
#    glowing: false # makes the thing glow
#
#    # projectile specific stuff
#    onFire: true # defaults to false, whatever or not make it incendiary
#    charged: false # works only for wither skulls, makes it charged
#    critical: false # works for arrows and tridents, makes the try visible
#
#    # this stuff is for throwable projectiles only, such as snowballs
#    material: SNOWBALL # you can set any material https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/Material.html
#    customModelData: 123 # must be an integer, texturepack magic number goes here
